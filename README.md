# TSG Apprentice Summative Repo
This is the repository where you should store your solution for your mastery project.

## **Common Steps / Solo Workflow**

Once you have cloned this repository cloned - here is a reminder of the workflow you'll follow (for the most part).

1.  Make some changes.
    *   This means new files, or modifying existing files already in the repository.
    *   Save all the changes and get ready for staging.
2.  Stage your changes w/ _git add_
    *   Run **git status**
    *   If you observe 'red' text files - it means you have some things to add!

    *   use the command <span style="color: #ff0000;">**git add --all .**</span> to add all files to the staging area.
3.  Commit your staged files w/ _git commit_
    *   Run **git status**
    *   If you observe 'green' text files - it means you staged your changes, and are ready to commit!

    *   use the command <span style="color: #ff0000;">**git commit -m "A message about your changes"**</span> to commit your files to a save point.
4.  Push your changes to the server with _git push_
    *   Run **git status**
    *   If you have no red, or green text and just a note about you being ahead by a # of commits - it's time to push!
_<details><summary>Expand for visual example...</summary><img src=".github/imgs/GitPush.png" alt="Pushing Changes to GitHub"/></details>_
    *   use the command <span style="color: #ff0000;">**git push origin master**</span> to push all your changes up to the server repository.
5.  Check your status w/ _git status_ & start making new changes!
    *   Run **git status**
    *   If it says you're up to date w/ the server, you're good to start coding again!
_<details><summary>Expand for visual example...</summary><img src=".github/imgs/GitRepo.png" alt="No Changes in GitHub"/></details>_
    *   When you have new changes to save, go back to step 1, and add/commit/push all over again!
